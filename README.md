# Stack

This is just a demonstration that I can get a few things put together and they still make sense to me. Looking for the bigger picture.

* nbdev to get documentation, tests, and library code out of Jupyter
* Docker + Flask + gunicorn to serve a micro service
* DVC + git for version control and (at least) a training pipeline
